Code for the paper [Neuronal correlations shape the scaling behavior of memory capacity and nonlinear computational capability of reservoir recurrent neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19657).

Data required for drawing figures in jupyter notebook files is obtained by runnning corresponding Python scripts with filenames starting with `calc_`.
